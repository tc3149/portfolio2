            Hi! My name is Thomas and I am a Third Year (Penultimate)
            Commerce/Computer Science Student at UNSW. I am largely a
            self-taught developer and am always keen to learn new tools or
            languages to apply to my personal projects. As a casual academic, I
            also assist UNSW's School of Computer Science with marking and
            tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am exploring web development (e.g. this website!)
            through React.js and mobile app development with React Native. I
            find full-stack development the most interesting at the moment; it
            is satisfying seeing and creating polished products with beautiful
            user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coursework, you can find me helping out at CSESoc or
            travelling with mates ‚úà
