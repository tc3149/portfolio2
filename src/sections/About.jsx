            Hi! My name is Thomas and I study Commerce/Computer Science Student
            at UNSW. I am largely a self-taught developer and am always keen to
            learn new tools or languages to apply to my personal projects. I
            have worked as junior software developer at a Startup called Qwokka
            where I get to practically apply my React and Typescript skills to
            develop and improve their website. Currently, I am interning at
            Optus for Cyber Security where I get to explore python
            scripting/automation and threat analysis
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am exploring web development (e.g. this website!)
            through React.js and mobile app development with React Native. I
            find full-stack development the most interesting at the moment; it
            is satisfying seeing and creating polished products with beautiful
            user interfaces. I am also highly interested in security engineering
            and am always curious to read up more about the latest updates
            within that field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coursework, ou can also find me competing in
            powerlifting, travelling or helping out at UNSW Investing For
            Charity as an IT Director.
          </p>
